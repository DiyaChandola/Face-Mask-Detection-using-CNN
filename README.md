# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN

	Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically detect face masks in images for public health monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic.
	Utilized TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the model on a dataset of 7,553 RGB images.
	Implemented key steps including image preprocessing, model training, and evaluation to ensure reliable real-time mask detection.
